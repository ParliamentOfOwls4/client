[Jiggy](https://jiggydrinkology.netlify.app/)

This React application is a pandemic-inspired collaboration between
three friends. We connected to RapidAPI's "Cocktail DB" database and
API. It allows you to search for cocktails you can make, just tell us
which alcohols and ingredients you have in your liquor cabinet. If
you're 'Feeling Jiggy' we'll suggest 10 random drinks to make.
