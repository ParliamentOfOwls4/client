# Welcome to [Jiggy - Drinkology](https://jiggydrinkology.netlify.app/) 

Got a full liquor cabinet and don't know what to make? Jiggy can help you. 

## How it works

Jiggy allows you to search for cocktails you can make just by telling us which alcohols and ingredients you have on hand. If you're 'Feeling Jiggy', we'll suggest 10 random drinks to make. If you are more curious about the type of liquor you have, select it in the drop-down menu to learn more about it and see drinks you can make. 

## Install dependancies
To run the application locally, first ```npm i``` and to spin up a local server, run ```npm run start```

three friends. Jiggy consumes RapidAPI's "Cocktail DB" database and
API.
